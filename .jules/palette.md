## 2024-08-30 - Multi-step Input Flows Need Focus Resilience
**Learning:** In VS Code extensions, multi-step input flows using `showInputBox` or `showQuickPick` are extremely brittle by default. If a user switches focus to copy text or check a file (a common need when creating snippets or naming things), the input silently aborts and loses all progress.
**Action:** Always add `ignoreFocusOut: true` to input box and quick pick options in multi-step flows to allow users to switch context safely without losing state.
