## 2024-05-24 - Avoid vscode.workspace.getConfiguration in tight loops
**Learning:** Calling `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration` within a per-file loop (like `TreeDataProvider.getChildren`'s file filter) creates significant performance overhead due to repeated IPC and configuration resolution per item.
**Action:** Always hoist configuration lookups out of loops. In tree providers or filesystem walkers, resolve configurations like `files.exclude` once per directory or workspace folder, and pass the resolved values down to the filtering logic.
